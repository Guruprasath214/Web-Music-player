## Conclusion

Your music app project has a strong foundation and can be completed in phases. Start with deployment and testing to get it live, then gradually add features based on user feedback and your vision for the app.

The most important next step is to **deploy your current version** and start getting real-world usage data. This will help you prioritize which features to add next and ensure you're building something people actually want to use.

Remember: A simple, working app that's live is better than a complex app that's still in development. Ship early, ship often, and iterate based on feedback!
